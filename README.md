## A Novel Network-Flow Model for Building Evacuation

Integrate human behavior into the traditional network-flow model for building evacuation.  
The model is useful to investigate egress performance in building environment.  

Expected Result: When human intelligence is taken into account, the model is self-optimized locally.  Human will optimize their route choices in local areas, and traditional optimization tools are only useful in a global sense.  

Highlights: The traditional network-flow model does not consider human intelligence and it relies on mathmatical tools to find an optimal route for evacuees.  The new model considers behavioral feature of evacuees and the model turns out to be self-optimized in a local sense.
